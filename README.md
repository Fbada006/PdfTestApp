# PdfTestApp

This is a simple application that is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture in 100% Kotlin. It has the
following features:

1. Displays all the PDF files that the user has in the `Download` folder as long as the permissions have been granted,
   otherwise they are
   requested with an explanation of why they are needed.
2. A search functionality to allow the user to find PDF files based on the query
3. Allows the user to star/unstar items for a favorite feature
4. Allows clicking of individual items to open the PDF using the PSPDFKIT library

# Prerequisites

The app was built using Android Studio Dolphin | 2021.3.1 so try running at least that version of Android studio. As for
testing devices,
ensure they are at least running Android API 23 and above. Running UI tests can be done straight from the Android Studio
UI.

## Architecture

The app uses the MVVM architecure because it is a nice and simple architecture that makes testing and maintenance
easier. It was also chosen
because it is a popular choice meaning a new developer can pick it up easily making for smooth transitions between
teams. There is also the
added benefit of using a `ViewModel` to survive configuration changes. `Kotlin Flow` and `Coroutines` have been used to
monitor data and
state changes in the app making for a smooth user experience.

> **_NOTE ON NAVIGATION:_**  The decision to use the previous navigation component as opposed
> to [Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is extremely intentional
> since there are type checks enforced. Debugging on the Navigation Compose component can be a nightmare especially when
> you pass a wrong
> type by mistake. The component will fail at run time whereas the older component will fail at compile time.
> Additionally, the
> older navigation component has the added benefit of allowing the use of parcelable types as well as the opportunity
> to have the flexibility of fragments and experience the best of both worlds. This makes for a cleaner architecture in
> my opinion.

## Extras

#### CI-Pipeline

The app also uses GitHub actions to build the app and runs whenever a new pull request or merge to the `master` branch
happens.
The pipeline also runs unit tests. The status of the build is displayed at the top of this file.
